[spawner]
# For scalability, worker containers can run on separate physical hosts. At least one
# spawner and one health check worker should be launched on each worker host, and the
# host_id should be the unique for each worker host.
host_id: 0

# An addressable IP for the spawner's host. This config is not currently used but could
# be at a future date to support a conatiner scheduler like swarm or mesos.
host_ip: 172.17.0.1

# When new workers are spawned, a config file must be mounted for communication with rabbit and redis.
# This path should be an absolute path *on the host* where such a config file exists. By default, spawners
# read this path from an environment variable, abaco_conf_host_path, but if this variable isn't set spawners
# will fall back to using this configuration.
# abaco_conf_host_path: /path/to/abaco.conf

# the maximum number of workers that are allowed to simultaneously be running on a given compute host.
# Spawners will unsubscribe from the command channel when this threshold is met.
# For local development, we intentially keep the max workers small:
max_workers_per_host: 10


[docker]
# url to use for docker daemon by spawners and workers. Currently only the unix socket is
# supported but other options could be implemented in the future.

[workers]
# number of worker containers to initially start when an actor is created

# set to -1 for indefinite execution time.

# length of time, in seconds, to keep an idle worker alive. Set to -1 to keep workers
# alive indefinitely.
# Set the ttl to 10 minutes.

# Set the ttl to 24 hours.
# worker_ttl: 86400

# whether worker containers should be scheduled with the auto_remove flag. In general, this should be set to true

# a list of mounts to make for every actor container, separated by comma (,) characters.
# Mounts should be of the form <absolute_host_path>:<absolute_container_path>:<mode>

# Token replacement done at runtime for the following:
# tenant_id: the tenant id associated with the actor.
# username: the username of the owner of the actor.
# tasdir: the homeDirectory attribute returned from tas. This attribute requires the
# use_tas_uid field to be set.

# whether to leave the actor containers or remove them. Should be False in
# staging/production but setting True can be helpful when debugging locally.
leave_containers: False

# whether to run the actor containers as the UID associated with the owner of the actor.
# requires TAS_ROLE_ACCT and TAS_ROLE_PASS passes as environment variables.
# Default value is False in which case the container run as the UID set in the container image.
